          <p>
            Women Who Design is a Twitter directory of accomplished women in the
            design industry. It aims to help people find notable and relevant
            voices to follow on Twitter by parsing Twitter bios for popular
            keywords.
          </p>
          <p>Here are some things Women Who Design can help you with:</p>
          <h2 className={styles.emphasis}>
            Use{" "}
            <a href="https://www.proporti.onl/" target="_blank">
              proporti.onl
            </a>{" "}
            to check the ratio of the people you follow on Twitter.
          </h2>
          <p>
            If you're following more men than women, use this project to follow
            new women and diversify the voices in your feed. Be aware that a
            feed of white women is not diverse.
          </p>
          <h2 className={styles.emphasis}>
            If you're a hiring manager, use this project to find candidates.{" "}
          </h2>
          <p>
            Examine the ratio of senior men to senior women in your
            organization. Are women of color equally represented? Consider
            hiring women into promotions above their current role.
          </p>

          <h2 className={styles.emphasis}>
            If you're organizing a conference, use this project to find
            speakers.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Ensure that the women's speaking slots are as prominent as the
            men's. Are women of color equally represented? Consider reaching out
            to women who have never given a talk before.
          </p>

          <h2 className={styles.emphasis}>
            If you have a podcast, use this project to find new guests.{" "}
          </h2>
          <p>
            Be mindful of interruptions and ensure that your women guests get
            equal speaking time. Are women of color equally represented?
            Consider inviting women who don't already have an audience.
